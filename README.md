# Linear & Logistic Regression Ml-Python

**Linear regression** is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

<br/>
**Logistic regression**, a supervised learning method, predicts binary outcomes by transforming output through a logistic function, producing probabilities between 0 and 1. It adapts linear regression principles, employing coefficients to shape the decision boundary. Widely used, it's valued for simplicity and interpretability in binary classification tasks.

Since these two models perform well with continuous characteristics, I selected datasets in such manner.
